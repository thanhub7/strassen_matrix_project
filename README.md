# Raspberry Pi + Arduino Matrix Multiplication

This project demonstrates how to offload a submatrix multiplication task from a Raspberry Pi to an Arduino Due using UART serial communication. The main computation (e.g., Strassen's algorithm) is coordinated on the Pi, while the Arduino handles selected multiplications.
