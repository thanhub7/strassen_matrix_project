# Raspberry Pi + Arduino Matrix Multiplication

This project demonstrates how to offload a submatrix multiplication task from a Raspberry Pi to an Arduino Due using UART serial communication. The main computation (e.g., Strassen's algorithm) is coordinated on the Pi, while the Arduino handles selected multiplications.


Finished only until M1 calculation by Arduino
